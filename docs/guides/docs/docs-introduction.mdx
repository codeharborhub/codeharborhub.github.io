The **CodeHarborHub Docs** feature gives you a powerful way to create and organize
Markdown/MDX content in a **structured, hierarchical format**—perfect for building
technical documentation, courses, or developer guides.

:::info
Check the [Docs Plugin API Reference](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs)  
for a complete list of configuration options.
:::

Your documentation is organized into **four levels**, from smallest to largest:

1. **Individual Pages** – Basic `.md` or `.mdx` files with front matter.  
2. **Sidebars** – Define navigation and grouping of related docs.  
3. **Versions** – Manage multiple versions of your documentation.  
4. **Plugin Instances** – Run multiple independent docs sections in a single site.

This guide introduces each layer step-by-step: starting with
[creating individual pages](./docs-create-doc.mdx),  
then [building sidebars](./sidebar/index.mdx),  
followed by [versioning your content](./versioning.mdx),  
and finally [using multiple docs plugin instances](./docs-multi-instance.mdx).

## Docs-only Mode {#docs-only-mode}

By default, a CodeHarborHub site includes **Docs**, **Blog**, and **Pages**.  
A fresh installation looks like this:

```

example.com/                               -> from `src/pages/index.js`
example.com/docs/intro                      -> from `docs/intro.md`
example.com/docs/tutorial-basics/...        -> from `docs/tutorial-basics/...`
example.com/blog/2025/09/19/welcome         -> from `blog/2025-09-19-welcome/index.md`

```

All docs are served under the `docs/` subroute.  
But what if you want **docs as the homepage** or you’re building a **documentation-only** site?

### Enable Docs-Only Mode

In `docusaurus.config.js`, set the docs plugin `routeBasePath` to `/`  
and (optionally) disable the blog:

```js title="docusaurus.config.js"
export default {
  // ...
  presets: [
    [
      '@docusaurus/preset-classic',
      {
        docs: {
          // highlight-next-line
          routeBasePath: '/', // Serve docs at the site root
          /* other docs plugin options */
        },
        // highlight-next-line
        blog: false, // Optional: disable the blog
      },
    ],
  ],
};
````

This moves your docs from:

```
https://example.com/docs/some-doc
```

to:

```
https://example.com/some-doc
```

### Setting a Docs Homepage

Add front matter to the doc you want as the root page:

```md title="docs/intro.md"
---
# highlight-next-line
slug: /
---

Welcome to CodeHarborHub Docs!  
This page is now the homepage.
```

Now your site’s structure will look like:

```
example.com/                       -> generated from `docs/intro.md`
example.com/tutorial-basics/...    -> generated from `docs/tutorial-basics/...`
```
