### 💡 Submission Tips
1.  **Be Specific:** Instead of saying "I will write tests," say "I will achieve 80% code coverage using Vitest."
2.  **Ask for Feedback:** Share your draft with us on Discord **before** the final deadline.
3.  **Proofread:** A clean, well-formatted proposal shows you care about your work.

> **Good luck! We can't wait to see your innovative ideas.**
