# ⭐ Support @ajay-dhangar for the GitHub Stars Program

Your support has made CodeHarborHub the valuable learning platform it is today. Now, we have a unique opportunity to expand our reach!

The **GitHub Stars Program** recognizes influential developers who inspire, educate, and influence global developer communities. As a user, learner, or contributor, your nomination is the single most important factor.

## Why Your Nomination Matters

GitHub is looking for stories of impact. They want to hear directly from people whose learning journeys were changed by my work. They are **not** looking for the number of stars a repo has—they are looking for **community-driven mentorship and influence.**

### What Makes a Star (The 3 Pillars)

| Pillar | Example from Your Work |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Inspire** | You were inspired to start a new project or contribute to open source because of the community or resources I built. |
| **Educate** | My tutorials, articles, or the CodeHarborHub platform finally made complex concepts (like Data Structures or a specific framework) *click* for you. |
| **Influence** | I've actively mentored you or the community, providing a welcoming and positive environment that changed how you view coding or collaboration. |
